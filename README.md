# WWDC2018

**Introduction**

Hi, I would like to share my Scholarship Playground Submission to you! Hope you may leave some suggestion to me so I can improve better next year!😝

Rejected

**Description**
The topic of my Playground is ‘Introducing Hong Kong’. The aim of this Playground is introducing Hong Kong to different people all over the world and while you are learning things about Hong Kong, you can learn some basic coding skills as well. That’s why I choose Playground Book to present my work. I used the template of Apple and modified to be my Playground. Please use your iPad (horizontal) to run my Playground Book.
